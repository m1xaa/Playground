This is an implementation of an idea I came up with at Eestec LC AI Hackathon.
Simple yet effective application called Playgroung that uses Llama 70b model for geenrating creative tasks for young kids.
To run this application you need to have installed angular and django on your machine.
if you have the prerequisits installed you can run following commands:
Position at
  backend folder and type: python manage.py runserver
  frontend folder and type: ng serve
